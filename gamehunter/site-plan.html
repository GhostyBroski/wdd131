      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To create online spaces for those of us who want to skip the research and go right for the fun, pairing meaningful reviews from multiple sources with a diverse array of games, putting all of the information you need to make a good purchase in one spot while saving gamers hours of game hunting and following false leads.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience consists of people who are 13+, due to the nature of how most games are rated. Essentially, all gamers are welcome here since this is for gamers who are looking for new games to play, by gamers. Thus, while it isn't necessarily inappropriate or non-family friendly, parental guidance is still advised since some games are more maturely rated. Additionally, this is for those who enjoy website embedded games.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will use javascript to keep track of several things! I was thinking of using a list for events within the game "Trailblazer", randomly picking from this list to subject players to these events as they progress. That, or a random chance of an even in the same level taking place when doing another action. (So, a chance to activate a random event if the player rested. Also, a random event when going to the next stage.) I was also thinking about having a different list dependent on the stage, or range of stages that they are currently on, but to keep it simple, I might stick to one list. I will also use dynamic elements to switch the game photo and text when needed, as well as implementing functionality for the buttons the player can use.

          <strong>Pitching Game Hunter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Think back to the last time you bought a video game. Did you spend hours searching through online stores for the perfect game? Were you convinced of this game's worth by a particularly charming Steam review? When you bought the game, was it everything it was chalked up to be? Chances are, it was not. That's where we come in, saving you hours of following false leads and hunting for games that sometimes don't even exist. I'm happy to let you know the hunt is over now, and that we have all the games you could ask for!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We have a huge variety of games!</strong>
        </p>

          With a diverse array of games, we'll be able to save you hours of time you'd normally spend scouring the internet... whether that's on Steam, Itch, or some other game platform. From the plagued residual ruins of the far edges of Hollow Knight to the high speed action found on the dangerous streets of Palm City in Need For Speed: Heat, we have got it all! With that in mind, we definitely won't leave any place un-explored, making sure to cover any game out there we can catch our sights on, making up the best comprehensive library of games to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Search is Over!</strong>

To do that, we will give you the best ratings and reviews that we can provide so that you'll be able to find what you need with ease. Keeping this in mind, we'll hopefully be able to help you avoid all the usual fluff that you're used to when looking for something to play.

        </p>
        <p>

          Our team of game hunters have scoured the internet so that we can all be able to just have fun instead of mulling over what we might do next. Of course, you would still have to look through what we put together, but that is so much faster then being all on your own, surfing the web. Whether it's checking other game libraries, actively updating the site, or making sure the reviews we display accurately and appropriately go over the games they're about, we made sure everything is in order - from the games, to the pictures, to the other information provided.

          <strong>Hollow Knight</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: While challenging players, this game delivers with a unique art style and beautiful sound track, mystifying players, explorers, and killers alike as they venture through the durges of Hollow Knight. Considered a "Souls-like" of sorts, this game offers an awesome experience and rewards creativity as you diversify how you play as well as your build. Overall, this game is absolutely fantastic, with interesting mechanics, user friendly controls, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cuphead</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: Be it the nostalgic, rubber hose animation style or the flowy old-timey designs and symbolism from the roaring 20s, Cuphead is a diffulct yet fair game that has won the hearts of many with its unique charm. From a "glorious" experience to the challenges within, Cuphead makes you feel like you earned everything you fight for, be it the upgrades you get or the bosses you beat. Overall, it's an amazing game, even if you're the one who ends up "Whalloped!" in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: This is a super immersive game that somehow has created the perfect cross between a happy-go-lucky, bouncy art style and the eldritch horrors that can be found in the vestiges of the realm of the old faith. Considered one of the most enjoyable games as of late, Cult of the Lamb has been an amazing simulator where you can fight your way through your enemies, go on various quests while exploring, or spend your time taking care of your cult, followers, and the like. All in all, this game is brilliant, and deserves all the praise it gets and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mario Kart 8</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: Chaotic and as frustrating as it is, Mario Kart 8 is pretty much considered a household game due to how intoxicatingly addictive it is! Whether you need to itch that competitive spirit deep inside you with intense races and high stakes, or to casually make your way through diverse, colorful, and fun maps to pass the time, this game has it! At least, it stands now as one of the must fun, replayable games, with plent of options and variety that makes it something simply incredible. Overall, Mario Kart 8 is an awesome game, whether you're playing solo or with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dark Souls III</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Very Positive
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Very Positive
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: Offering a difficult yet amazing experience from the intricately designed bosses, gorgeous / breath-taking atmosphere, and jarring level design to various NPCs and the story within, Dark Souls III is a great game. However, it doesn't exactly take the title of "creme de la creme" since it falters at some point, with some of the story being guarded by DLC and it feeling like the 1st 2 games of the trilogy weren't addressed. Despite this, the game can be brutal, but definitely isn't impossible where players can enjoy an unforgettable experience that'll evoke many emotions for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outlast</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ratings: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus: Keeping players on edge, this first-person survival horror delivers a terrifying experience, with scares lurking around every corner as much as the story behind the abandoned psychiatric hospital it all takes place in. With questionable pacing and terror struck into the hearts of players, this game has become notorious among horror games with exceptional atmosphere and world building, relentless tension and suspense, and psychological horror elements that haunt those who make their way through the halls of Outlast. While it isn't very replayable, this game is an amazing, immersive experience for those willing to take it on.

          <strong>How We Started Hunting:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we started out, there wasn't exactly a "game plan" set out in front of us. I mean, we just wanted to be able to spend our time enjoying well crafted games, sharing laughs, and making memories along the way. So, to commemorate and show off our journey, we created "Trailblazer"! This nifty game will give you some good insights to how we felt exploring for answers and ways to bring everything together, with it all possibly being able to change at the drop of a hat. We hope you enjoy your journey, whatever that may look like as we learned to enjoy ours.
